# Report: Total Sales from Food Items for a Local Fast-Food Chain

## Introduction

The objective of this analysis was to determine the total sales generated from food items (excluding drinks) for a local fast-food chain. The sales data was provided in an Excel file located at `/Users/khoa/.cache/huggingface/hub/datasets--gaia-benchmark--GAIA/snapshots/897f2dfbb5c952b5c3c1509e648381f9c7b70316/2023/validation/7bd855d8-463d-4ed5-93ca-5fe35145f733.xlsx`. The analysis required summing up the sales figures for food categories while excluding drinks, and presenting the result in USD with two decimal places.

## Data Structure and Analysis Process

### Data Structure
The Excel file contained the following columns:
- **Location**: Represents the location of the fast-food chain.
- **Burgers**: Sales revenue from burgers.
- **Hot Dogs**: Sales revenue from hot dogs.
- **Salads**: Sales revenue from salads.
- **Fries**: Sales revenue from fries.
- **Ice Cream**: Sales revenue from ice cream.
- **Soda**: Sales revenue from soda (a drink).

Each row in the dataset represented a specific location, with sales figures for each menu category.

### Analysis Steps
1. **Data Inspection**: The structure of the dataset was inspected to identify relevant columns for food and drinks. It was determined that all columns except `Soda` represented food items.
2. **Summation of Food Sales**: The sales figures for the food categories (`Burgers`, `Hot Dogs`, `Salads`, `Fries`, `Ice Cream`) were summed across all rows (locations).
3. **Exclusion of Drinks**: The `Soda` column, representing drinks, was excluded from the summation.
4. **Formatting the Result**: The total sales were rounded to two decimal places and expressed in USD.

### Key Assumptions
- The sales figures in the dataset were already in USD.
- All columns except `Soda` represented food items, including `Ice Cream`, which was considered a dessert and part of food.

## Results

The total sales from food items (excluding drinks) were calculated as **$89,706.00 USD**. This result was derived by summing the sales figures for the columns `Burgers`, `Hot Dogs`, `Salads`, `Fries`, and `Ice Cream` across all rows in the dataset.

### Calculation Details
To illustrate the calculation process:
1. For the first row (Location: Pinebrook), the sum of food sales was:
   - Burgers: $1,594
   - Hot Dogs: $1,999
   - Salads: $2,002
   - Fries: $2,005
   - Ice Cream: $1,977
   - **Total for Pinebrook**: $1,594 + $1,999 + $2,002 + $2,005 + $1,977 = $9,577

2. This process was repeated for all 9 rows (locations) in the dataset, and the totals were summed to arrive at the final result:
   - **Total Food Sales Across All Locations**: $89,706.00

### Summary Table
Below is a summary of the sales data:

| **Category**   | **Included in Food Sales?** | **Example Sales (Row 1)** |
|----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Burgers        | Yes                         | $1,594                    |
| Hot Dogs       | Yes                         | $1,999                    |
| Salads         | Yes                         | $2,002                    |
| Fries          | Yes                         | $2,005                    |
| Ice Cream      | Yes                         | $1,977                    |
| Soda           | No                          | $1,980                    |

**Note**: The total sales for food items were calculated by summing the values in the columns marked as "Yes" under "Included in Food Sales?"

## Source Reliability and Information Quality

The analysis was based on the provided Excel file, which was assumed to contain accurate and complete sales data. The following steps ensured the reliability of the results:
- The dataset was inspected to confirm its structure and content.
- The calculations were performed using Python, a reliable programming language for data analysis.
- The results were verified by cross-checking intermediate calculations.

## Limitations and Areas for Further Investigation

1. **Data Context**: The dataset did not provide additional context, such as the time period for the sales data or the number of transactions per location. This information could provide deeper insights into sales trends.
2. **Category Classification**: The classification of `Ice Cream` as a food item was based on the assumption that desserts are part of food. If the definition of "food" excludes desserts, the total sales figure would need to be recalculated.
3. **Data Completeness**: The analysis assumed that the dataset was complete and free of errors. Any missing or incorrect data could affect the results.

## Conclusion

The total sales from food items (excluding drinks) for the local fast-food chain were calculated to be **$89,706.00 USD**. This result was derived by summing the sales figures for the food categories (`Burgers`, `Hot Dogs`, `Salads`, `Fries`, and `Ice Cream`) across all locations, while excluding the `Soda` column. The analysis was conducted using Python, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

This result provides a clear and actionable insight into the revenue generated from food items, which can be used for further business analysis and decision-making.
