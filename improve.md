# Understanding GRPO, DAPO, and VAPO: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in Large Language Model Training

The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. Central to this progress is the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, which refine model behavior by optimizing policies based on reward signals. Among the RL algorithms tailored for LLM training, GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization), DAPO (Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization), and VAPO (Value Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization) have emerged as pivotal frameworks, each addressing unique challenges in training and performance.

GRPO, a value-free RL method, simplifies advantage estimation by leveraging group reward normalization. Instead of relying on a value model, GRPO computes trajectory-level advantages directly from aggregated rewards within a group of sampled responses. This approach mitigates the computational overhead of value model training while providing a stable baseline for advantage calculation. However, GRPO faces limitations in handling entropy collapse and reward noise, particularly in complex reasoning tasks ([Shao et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300)).

DAPO builds upon GRPO by introducing innovative techniques to enhance training stability and efficiency. Its key contributions include the Clip-Higher strategy, which decouples clipping ranges to prevent entropy collapse and promote exploration; Dynamic Sampling, which ensures consistent gradient signals by filtering out prompts with zero or full accuracy; Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss, which rebalances the influence of long sequences; and Overlong Reward Shaping, which penalizes excessively lengthy responses to stabilize training. These advancements enable DAPO to outperform GRPO in reasoning-intensive tasks while maintaining scalability ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

VAPO represents a paradigm shift by adopting a value-model-based approach to RL. Unlike GRPO and DAPO, VAPO incorporates a trained value model to provide precise credit assignment for actions, reducing variance and enhancing optimization. It addresses critical challenges in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, such as value model bias, heterogeneous sequence lengths, and reward sparsity. Techniques like Length-Adaptive Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) and token-level loss calculation further refine its performance. VAPO integrates elements from prior frameworks, including DAPO and VC-PPO, to achieve state-of-the-art results in reasoning tasks ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

This report delves into the mechanisms and comparative strengths of GRPO, DAPO, and VAPO, highlighting their contributions to LLM training. By examining their approaches to advantage estimation, reward handling, and sequence length management, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of these algorithms and their impact on advancing large language models.

## Introduction to RL Algorithms in LLM Training

### Reinforcement Learning in Large Language Models

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in training large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks requiring reasoning, decision-making, and alignment with human preferences. Unlike supervised learning, RL optimizes policies based on reward signals derived from the model's interactions with its environment. In the context of LLMs, RL is often used to refine pre-trained models, enabling them to generate responses that align with desired objectives, such as accuracy, coherence, or ethical considerations ([Schulman et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347)).

The RL framework for LLM training typically involves modeling language generation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Here, the states represent the sequence of tokens generated so far, actions correspond to the next token to be generated, and rewards are scalar feedback signals that evaluate the quality of the generated sequence. This token-level MDP structure allows RL algorithms to optimize the model's policy for generating high-quality responses ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

### Challenges in RL for LLMs

Training LLMs using RL presents unique challenges that differ from traditional RL applications. These include:

1. **Sparse Reward Signals**: In many tasks, rewards are only provided at the end of a sequence, making it difficult to assign credit to individual actions within the sequence. This sparsity complicates the optimization process and often requires advanced techniques like Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) to reduce variance ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

2. **Long Sequence Lengths**: LLMs often generate lengthy outputs, especially in reasoning tasks. Managing these long sequences requires algorithms to balance bias and variance effectively, as errors can propagate across the sequence, leading to instability ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

3. **Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff**: RL algorithms must strike a balance between exploring diverse responses and exploiting known high-quality patterns. Over-exploration can lead to gibberish outputs, while excessive exploitation may cause the model to converge prematurely to suboptimal solutions ([Shao et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300)).

### Key RL Algorithms in LLM Training

Several RL algorithms have been developed to address these challenges, each with unique mechanisms tailored for LLM training:

#### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

PPO is a widely used RL algorithm in LLM training due to its stability and efficiency. It employs a clipped surrogate objective to constrain policy updates within a trust region, preventing large updates that could destabilize training. PPO also uses GAE to estimate advantages, reducing variance in reward signals ([Schulman et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347)).

#### Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)

GRPO is a value-free RL method that eliminates the need for a value model. Instead, it computes advantages based on group reward normalization, assigning trajectory-level rewards to individual tokens. This approach simplifies computation but faces limitations in handling entropy collapse and reward sparsity ([Shao et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300)).

#### Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO)

DAPO builds upon GRPO by introducing techniques like Clip-Higher, Dynamic Sampling, and Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss. These innovations address entropy collapse, reward noise, and gradient decay, enabling more stable and efficient training for long chain-of-thought reasoning tasks ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

#### Value Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization (VAPO)

VAPO represents a paradigm shift by incorporating a value model to provide precise credit assignment for actions. It addresses challenges like value model bias, heterogeneous sequence lengths, and sparse rewards through techniques such as Length-Adaptive GAE and token-level loss. VAPO achieves state-of-the-art performance in reasoning-intensive tasks ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

### RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback

A specialized application of RL in LLM training is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF uses human-provided reward signals to align model outputs with human preferences. This approach has been instrumental in fine-tuning models like OpenAI's GPT series, enabling them to generate responses that are both accurate and contextually appropriate ([Ouyang et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155)).

---

This section introduces the foundational concepts of RL in LLM training, focusing on the challenges and the algorithms designed to address them. Subsequent sections will delve deeper into the specifics of GRPO, DAPO, and VAPO, highlighting their mechanisms and comparative strengths.

## Overview of GRPO Algorithm

### Mechanisms of GRPO: Group-Based Advantage Estimation

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a value-free reinforcement learning algorithm designed to simplify the computation of advantages during policy optimization. Unlike value-model-based methods, GRPO eliminates the need for a value network, relying instead on group reward normalization to estimate advantages. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where training a reliable value model is challenging due to instability or computational overhead ([Shao et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300)).

GRPO operates by sampling a group of responses for each prompt and calculating the advantage for each response relative to the group's reward distribution. The advantage estimation formula is as follows:

\[
\hat{A}_i = \frac{R_i - \text{mean}(R)}{\text{std}(R)}
\]

Where \(R_i\) is the reward for the \(i\)-th response, and \(\text{mean}(R)\) and \(\text{std}(R)\) are the mean and standard deviation of rewards within the group. This normalization mitigates variance in reward signals, providing a stable baseline for policy updates ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

### Addressing Reward Sparsity and Entropy Collapse

One of the primary challenges in GRPO is managing sparse reward signals, which are common in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. GRPO assigns trajectory-level rewards to individual tokens, simplifying the credit assignment process. However, this approach can lead to entropy collapse, where the model's exploration capability diminishes as it converges prematurely to deterministic policies ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

To counter entropy collapse, GRPO incorporates a clipped surrogate objective similar to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The objective function is defined as:

\[
J_{\text{GRPO}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \min \left( r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) \hat{A}_t \right) \right]
\]

Where \(r_t(\theta)\) is the probability ratio between the current policy and the old policy, and \(\epsilon\) is the clipping range. This clipping mechanism prevents large updates to the policy, ensuring training stability ([Shao et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300)).

### Limitations and Areas for Improvement

While GRPO simplifies advantage estimation and reduces computational complexity, it faces several limitations:

1. **Reward Noise**: The reliance on group reward normalization can introduce noise, particularly in tasks with heterogeneous sequence lengths or sparse rewards. This noise can hinder the model's ability to learn fine-grained reasoning patterns ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

2. **Gradient Decay**: GRPO's sample-level loss calculation can lead to gradient decay when all responses within a group receive identical rewards. This issue reduces the effective number of prompts contributing to policy updates, impacting training efficiency ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

3. **Limited Exploration**: The absence of mechanisms to explicitly promote exploration, such as dynamic sampling or entropy control, restricts GRPO's ability to handle complex reasoning tasks effectively ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

These limitations have paved the way for the development of advanced algorithms like DAPO and VAPO, which address GRPO's shortcomings by introducing techniques for entropy control, dynamic sampling, and value-model-based optimization.

This section focuses on GRPO's mechanisms, challenges, and limitations, complementing the existing content by providing a detailed analysis of its advantage estimation process and clipped objective function. It avoids overlapping with previous sections by emphasizing GRPO's unique features and areas for improvement.

## Overview of DAPO Algorithm

### Key Innovations in DAPO: Enhancing Stability and Efficiency

Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO) is a reinforcement learning algorithm specifically designed to address the limitations of GRPO in large language model (LLM) training. DAPO introduces several novel techniques that improve training stability, efficiency, and scalability, particularly for long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. These innovations include Clip-Higher, Dynamic Sampling, Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss, and Overlong Reward Shaping ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

#### Clip-Higher Strategy for Entropy Control

Entropy collapse is a common issue in RL training, where the model prematurely converges to deterministic policies, limiting exploration. DAPO addresses this problem through the Clip-Higher strategy, which decouples the clipping ranges for importance sampling. By increasing the upper clipping range (\(e_{\text{high}}\)) while keeping the lower range (\(e_{\text{low}}\)) relatively small, DAPO allows low-probability tokens to increase their likelihood during training. This adjustment promotes diversity in sampled responses and prevents the collapse of the sampling space ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

Empirical results show that Clip-Higher significantly enhances the entropy of the actor model, facilitating exploration and improving training outcomes. For example, experiments on the AIME 2024 benchmark demonstrated smoother entropy curves and higher accuracy when Clip-Higher was applied ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

#### Dynamic Sampling for Gradient Consistency

In traditional RL algorithms like GRPO, prompts with uniform rewards (e.g., all responses receiving a reward of 1) can lead to gradient decay, reducing the effective number of prompts contributing to policy updates. DAPO mitigates this issue through Dynamic Sampling, which filters out prompts with zero or full accuracy and oversamples prompts with intermediate rewards. This ensures consistent gradient signals across batches, improving training efficiency and stability ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

Dynamic Sampling also accelerates convergence by maintaining a balanced distribution of prompts during training. Experiments revealed that DAPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on the AIME 2024 benchmark with only 50% of the training steps required by previous methods like DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

### Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss and Overlong Reward Shaping

#### Rebalancing Influence with Token-Level Loss

Unlike GRPO, which calculates loss at the sample level, DAPO employs Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss to address the imbalance caused by long sequences. In sample-level loss calculation, tokens within longer responses contribute less to the overall loss, which can hinder the model's ability to learn reasoning-relevant patterns. Token-Level Loss ensures that longer sequences have a proportionate influence on gradient updates, improving the model's ability to process complex reasoning tasks ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

This approach also reduces entropy spikes and stabilizes response length during training. For example, experiments showed healthier length scaling and reduced gibberish generation when Token-Level Loss was applied ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

#### Stabilizing Training with Overlong Reward Shaping

Long CoT reasoning tasks often produce excessively lengthy responses, which can introduce reward noise and destabilize training. DAPO addresses this challenge through Overlong Reward Shaping, which penalizes responses exceeding a predefined maximum length. This penalty is applied progressively, with longer responses receiving greater punishment. By signaling the model to avoid excessively long outputs, Overlong Reward Shaping enhances training stability and improves accuracy ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

Additionally, DAPO incorporates a soft punishment mechanism for truncated samples, allowing the model to balance exploration and exploitation effectively. Experiments demonstrated that Overlong Reward Shaping contributed to a 5-point improvement in accuracy on the AIME 2024 benchmark ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

### Comparative Performance and Scalability

#### Efficiency Gains in Long-CoT Tasks

DAPO's innovations collectively enable it to outperform GRPO and other baseline algorithms in reasoning-intensive tasks. For example, DAPO achieved 50 points on the AIME 2024 benchmark using the Qwen2.5-32B base model, surpassing GRPO's performance of 30 points and DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B's 47 points. These results highlight DAPO's ability to scale efficiently while maintaining training stability ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

#### Stability Across Metrics

DAPO's training dynamics exhibit smoother curves for response length, reward score, and entropy compared to GRPO. This stability is attributed to its advanced techniques, such as Clip-Higher and Dynamic Sampling, which address critical issues like entropy collapse and gradient decay. The algorithm's ability to maintain consistent performance across multiple runs further underscores its reliability ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

It avoids overlap with previous reports by emphasizing the technical details and comparative advantages of DAPO in LLM training.

## Overview of VAPO Algorithm

### Addressing Challenges in Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

VAPO (Value Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization) is a value-model-based reinforcement learning framework specifically designed to address the unique challenges of long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks in large language models (LLMs). Unlike value-free methods such as GRPO and DAPO, VAPO leverages a trained value model to provide precise credit assignment for actions, enabling finer-grained optimization and reducing variance in reward signals ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

#### Mitigating Value Model Bias

One of the primary challenges in value-model-based RL is the bias introduced during the initialization of the value model. VAPO addresses this issue through **Value Pretraining**, a technique that initializes the value model using Monte Carlo returns from a fixed policy. This pretraining phase ensures that the value model achieves low bias and high explained variance before being integrated into the RL training process ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

Additionally, VAPO employs **Decoupled Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)** to separate the advantage computation for the value and policy networks. For value updates, a high lambda (\( \lambda = 1.0 \)) is used to minimize bias, while a smaller lambda (\( \lambda = 0.95 \)) is applied for policy updates to accelerate convergence. This decoupling ensures stable optimization across long sequences ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

#### Managing Heterogeneous Sequence Lengths

VAPO introduces **Length-Adaptive GAE**, a novel technique that dynamically adjusts the lambda parameter in GAE computation based on the length of the generated sequences. This method ensures that the bias-variance tradeoff is optimized for both short and long responses. For example, longer sequences benefit from reduced bootstrapping errors, while shorter sequences avoid high variance in advantage estimates ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

To further enhance training stability, VAPO replaces sample-level loss calculations with **Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss**, ensuring that tokens from longer sequences contribute proportionately to the overall loss. This adjustment prevents the underweighting of long responses, which is a common issue in sample-level loss formulations ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

### Techniques for Reward Sparsity and Exploration-Exploitation Balance

#### Addressing Sparse Reward Signals

Sparse reward signals, particularly in verifier-based tasks, pose significant challenges in RL training for LLMs. VAPO mitigates this issue by integrating **Group Sampling**, a technique that aggregates rewards across multiple trajectories within a group. This approach reduces the reliance on explicit value estimation, which often suffers from instability in complex reasoning tasks ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

#### Enhancing Exploration and Exploitation

To balance exploration and exploitation, VAPO incorporates techniques such as **Clip-Higher** and **Positive Example Language Model (LM) Loss**. Clip-Higher allows low-probability tokens to increase their likelihood during training, promoting diversity in sampled responses. Positive Example LM Loss, on the other hand, maximizes the utility of correct answers by incorporating an additional negative log-likelihood loss for positive samples. This dual approach ensures efficient utilization of high-quality samples while maintaining exploration capabilities ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

### Comparative Performance and Efficiency

#### Training Stability and Efficiency

VAPO demonstrates remarkable stability and efficiency in RL training. For example, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AIME 2024 benchmark with only 5,000 training steps, significantly fewer than required by DAPO or GRPO. This efficiency is attributed to its integrated techniques, such as Length-Adaptive GAE and Value Pretraining, which streamline the optimization process ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

#### Performance Gains in Long-CoT Tasks

VAPO consistently outperforms value-free methods like GRPO and DAPO in reasoning-intensive tasks. On the AIME 2024 benchmark, VAPO achieves a score of 60.4, surpassing DAPO's 50 points and GRPO's 47 points. These results highlight VAPO's ability to handle complex reasoning tasks with higher accuracy and stability ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

---

This section builds on the existing content by focusing on VAPO's unique mechanisms, such as Value Pretraining, Length-Adaptive GAE, and Group Sampling, while avoiding overlap with previous subtopics. It emphasizes VAPO's comparative advantages and technical innovations in addressing challenges specific to long chain-of-thought reasoning tasks.

## Comparison of GRPO, DAPO, and VAPO in LLM Training

### Performance Metrics and Efficiency

The comparative performance of GRPO, DAPO, and VAPO in large language model (LLM) training can be analyzed through their efficiency, accuracy, and stability in handling complex reasoning tasks. Each algorithm demonstrates unique strengths and limitations:

| **Algorithm** | **Accuracy on AIME 2024 Benchmark** | **Training Steps Required** | **Entropy Stability** | **Handling Long Sequences** |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| GRPO          | 47 points ([Shao et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300)) | ~10,000 steps            | Moderate stability       | Limited optimization        |
| DAPO          | 50 points ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)) | ~5,000 steps             | High stability            | Improved handling           |
| VAPO          | 60.4 points ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)) | ~5,000 steps             | Exceptional stability     | Advanced optimization       |

While GRPO provides a stable baseline for advantage estimation, its reliance on group reward normalization limits its ability to handle long sequences effectively. DAPO improves upon GRPO by introducing techniques like Clip-Higher and Dynamic Sampling, which enhance entropy stability and reduce training steps. VAPO surpasses both GRPO and DAPO by leveraging a value-model-based framework, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and stability with fewer training steps ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

### Adaptability to Sparse Rewards

Sparse reward signals are a critical challenge in LLM training, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks. The algorithms differ in their approaches to managing sparse rewards:

- **GRPO**: GRPO computes trajectory-level advantages based on group reward normalization, which simplifies computation but struggles with sparse rewards due to limited exploration mechanisms ([Shao et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300)).
- **DAPO**: DAPO addresses sparse rewards through Overlong Reward Shaping, penalizing excessively lengthy responses to stabilize training. Additionally, Dynamic Sampling ensures that prompts with intermediate rewards are prioritized, improving gradient consistency ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).
- **VAPO**: VAPO integrates Group Sampling to aggregate rewards across multiple trajectories, reducing reliance on explicit value estimation. This approach enhances optimization in sparse reward scenarios, enabling finer-grained credit assignment ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

VAPO's advanced techniques for managing sparse rewards make it particularly effective in verifier-based tasks, where binary feedback signals are common.

### Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff

The exploration-exploitation tradeoff is a fundamental aspect of RL algorithms, influencing their ability to balance diversity in responses with convergence to optimal solutions:

- **GRPO**: GRPO's clipped objective constrains policy updates, ensuring stability but limiting exploration. This results in entropy collapse during long training sessions ([Shao et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300)).
- **DAPO**: DAPO introduces Clip-Higher to decouple clipping ranges, allowing low-probability tokens to increase their likelihood during training. This strategy promotes exploration while maintaining stability ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).
- **VAPO**: VAPO combines Clip-Higher with Positive Example LM Loss, maximizing the utility of correct answers while encouraging exploration. This dual approach ensures efficient utilization of high-quality samples without compromising diversity ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

Among the three algorithms, VAPO demonstrates the most balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoff, enabling it to achieve superior performance in reasoning-intensive tasks.

## Applications and Implications of These Algorithms in LLM Development

### Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities in Specialized Domains

The application of GRPO, DAPO, and VAPO algorithms in large language model (LLM) development has significantly advanced reasoning capabilities across specialized domains. While previous sections have focused on the mechanisms and comparative strengths of these algorithms, this section explores their practical implications in domain-specific tasks.

#### Mathematical Reasoning and Problem Solving

Mathematical reasoning tasks, such as solving competition-level problems, require models to generate precise, step-by-step solutions. VAPO has demonstrated exceptional performance in this domain by addressing challenges like sparse rewards and long sequence lengths. For instance, on the AIME 2024 benchmark, VAPO achieved a score of 60.4, surpassing DAPO's 50 points and GRPO's 47 points ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)). This improvement is attributed to VAPO's Length-Adaptive GAE and token-level loss, which optimize the model's ability to handle complex reasoning patterns.

DAPO also contributes to mathematical reasoning by stabilizing training through techniques like Overlong Reward Shaping and Dynamic Sampling. These methods ensure that the model avoids generating excessively lengthy or irrelevant responses, enhancing its accuracy in solving structured problems ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

#### Code Generation and Debugging

In the domain of code generation, RL algorithms like DAPO and VAPO have been instrumental in refining models to produce syntactically correct and logically coherent outputs. DAPO's Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss ensures that longer code snippets are appropriately weighted during training, reducing the likelihood of repetitive or erroneous patterns ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

VAPO further enhances code generation by leveraging its value-model-based framework to provide precise credit assignment for actions. This capability is particularly useful in debugging tasks, where the model must identify and correct errors in generated code. By integrating techniques like Positive Example LM Loss, VAPO maximizes the utility of correct outputs, enabling efficient debugging and iterative refinement ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

### Scaling LLMs for Long Chain-of-Thought Tasks

#### Addressing Long Sequence Challenges

The ability to scale LLMs for long chain-of-thought (CoT) tasks is a critical application of these RL algorithms. GRPO, while effective in simplifying advantage estimation, struggles with entropy collapse and gradient decay during long CoT reasoning. DAPO addresses these limitations through Clip-Higher and Dynamic Sampling, enabling the model to maintain stability and explore diverse reasoning paths ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

VAPO takes this scalability further by introducing Length-Adaptive GAE, which dynamically adjusts optimization parameters based on sequence length. This technique ensures that the model can handle both short and long responses effectively, making it ideal for tasks requiring extended reasoning, such as theorem proving or scientific analysis ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

#### Implications for Multimodal Models

The advancements in scaling LLMs for long CoT tasks have implications for multimodal models, which integrate text, images, and other data types. By refining token-level loss and reward shaping mechanisms, DAPO and VAPO enable multimodal models to generate coherent outputs across diverse modalities. For example, in medical diagnostics, these algorithms can help models analyze patient data and generate detailed reports that combine textual explanations with visual data ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

### Democratizing LLM Development Through Open-Source Systems

#### Accessibility and Reproducibility

The open-source nature of DAPO and VAPO has democratized LLM development, making advanced RL systems accessible to researchers and developers worldwide. DAPO's fully open-sourced training code and dataset, built on the Verl framework, provide a reproducible platform for large-scale RL experiments. This transparency addresses the challenges of replicating industry-level results, enabling the broader community to contribute to advancements in LLM training ([Yu et al., 2025](https://dapo-sia.github.io/static/pdf/dapo_paper.pdf)).

VAPO, while not fully open-sourced, integrates techniques from prior frameworks like VC-PPO and DAPO, ensuring compatibility with existing systems. Its emphasis on training stability and efficiency makes it a valuable resource for developing scalable LLMs in academic and industrial settings ([Yue et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118)).

#### Supporting Ethical AI Development

The accessibility of these algorithms also supports ethical AI development by enabling researchers to align LLM outputs with human values and preferences. For example, RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) can be integrated with DAPO and VAPO to refine models for tasks requiring ethical considerations, such as content moderation or bias detection ([Ouyang et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155)).
