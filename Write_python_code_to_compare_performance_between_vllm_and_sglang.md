# Benchmarking vLLM and SGLang: A Comparative Analysis of Performance

## Introduction

The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has necessitated the development of efficient inference frameworks to optimize their deployment. Among the leading contenders in this domain are **vLLM** and **SGLang**, two frameworks designed to enhance the performance of LLMs in distinct ways. This report aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of their performance by benchmarking key metrics such as throughput, latency, and memory efficiency using Python-based testing methodologies.

**vLLM** is widely recognized for its innovative **PagedAttention mechanism**, which optimizes memory usage during inference, making it particularly suitable for serving scenarios with limited hardware resources ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)). On the other hand, **SGLang**—a relatively newer framework—focuses on high-throughput, large-batch serving, leveraging advanced techniques like **RadixAttention** to excel in scenarios requiring concurrent processing of complex prompts ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).

The performance characteristics of these frameworks vary significantly depending on the use case. For example, SGLang has demonstrated superior throughput, achieving up to **3.1x higher tokens per second** compared to vLLM in specific benchmarks ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)). However, vLLM may outperform SGLang in latency for short prompts due to its efficient CUDA graph optimizations ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)). These differences highlight the importance of tailoring framework selection to the specific requirements of an application.

To conduct a fair and reproducible comparison, this report will utilize Python scripts to benchmark both frameworks under identical conditions. The tests will include:
1. **Sequential Requests**: Measuring latency and tokens per second for individual requests.
2. **Concurrent Requests**: Evaluating throughput and scalability under high-concurrency scenarios.
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Assessing resource utilization during inference.

The findings of this report will provide actionable insights for developers and organizations seeking to optimize their LLM deployments. By understanding the strengths and limitations of vLLM and SGLang, stakeholders can make informed decisions about which framework best aligns with their operational needs.

This comparative analysis is particularly relevant in the context of the growing adoption of **local AI solutions**, where organizations host LLMs on-premises to address concerns around data privacy and security ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)). As the demand for efficient and scalable inference frameworks continues to rise, this report aims to contribute valuable knowledge to the field.



## Introduction to vLLM and SGLang

### Core Features and Design Philosophy

**vLLM** is an inference framework designed to optimize the serving of large language models (LLMs) through its innovative **PagedAttention mechanism**, which reduces memory overhead during inference. This mechanism enables efficient handling of large-scale models, making vLLM particularly suitable for scenarios where hardware resources are constrained ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)). Additionally, vLLM supports **CUDA graph optimizations**, which enhance latency performance for short prompts by minimizing computational overhead during prefill operations ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).

In contrast, **SGLang** is tailored for high-throughput, large-batch serving scenarios. Its design philosophy revolves around maximizing efficiency in concurrent processing, leveraging advanced techniques such as **RadixAttention** to optimize token generation for complex prompts ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)). SGLang also excels in scenarios requiring shared prefixes across multiple requests, making it ideal for applications with repetitive or structured input patterns ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

### Deployment and Scalability

Both frameworks are designed to support deployment across multi-GPU setups, but their approaches differ significantly. **vLLM** utilizes **tensor parallelism**, which splits model computations across GPUs to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)). This makes vLLM a strong candidate for scenarios where hardware resources are limited but latency is critical.

On the other hand, **SGLang** employs **data parallelism**, which duplicates model computations across GPUs to maximize throughput. This approach is particularly effective for handling large batches of requests, as it allows SGLang to process significantly more tokens per second compared to vLLM ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)). For example, benchmarks have shown that SGLang achieves up to **3.1x higher throughput** than vLLM when processing large batches ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

### Optimization for Specific Use Cases

While both frameworks are versatile, their optimization strategies cater to different use cases. **vLLM** is optimized for latency-sensitive applications, such as chatbots or real-time systems, where individual request speed is paramount. Its **CUDA graph optimizations** and memory-efficient design make it particularly effective for short prompts and sequential requests ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).

Conversely, **SGLang** is designed for high-concurrency environments, such as enterprise-level batch processing or structured generation tasks. Its ability to maintain stable performance under heavy workloads makes it a preferred choice for applications requiring consistent throughput across large volumes of requests ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)). For example, in concurrent request scenarios, SGLang has demonstrated nearly double the throughput of vLLM, processing **75-78 tokens per second** compared to vLLM's **35-37 tokens per second** ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

This section builds on the existing content by focusing on the **deployment strategies** and **optimization for specific use cases**, which were not covered in the previous subtopic report. It complements the earlier discussion on core features and performance characteristics by providing a deeper dive into the frameworks' scalability and suitability for distinct application scenarios.

## Performance Metrics for Comparison

### Throughput: Tokens per Second (TPS)

Throughput, measured in tokens per second (TPS), is a critical metric for evaluating the efficiency of large language model (LLM) inference frameworks. It quantifies the number of tokens generated or processed by the framework within a given time frame. Higher throughput indicates better scalability and efficiency, especially for applications requiring high-volume processing.

#### Key Observations:
- **Sequential Requests**: In tests involving sequential requests, **SGLang** consistently outperformed **vLLM**. For example, when processing the **Llama3-70B-FP8** model on 2x Nvidia H100 GPUs, SGLang achieved **38 TPS**, compared to vLLM's **35 TPS** ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).
- **Concurrent Requests**: Under concurrent request scenarios, SGLang demonstrated a significant advantage. For the same model and hardware setup, SGLang maintained a stable throughput of **30-31 TPS**, while vLLM's performance declined from **22 TPS** to **16 TPS** as the number of concurrent requests increased ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

#### Comparison Table:

| **Framework** | **Scenario**              | **Model**          | **Hardware**         | **TPS** (Sequential) | **TPS** (Concurrent) |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| SGLang         | Sequential Requests       | Llama3-70B-FP8      | 2x Nvidia H100 GPUs   | 38                    | 30-31                |
| vLLM           | Sequential Requests       | Llama3-70B-FP8      | 2x Nvidia H100 GPUs   | 35                    | 16-22                |

These results highlight SGLang's superior scalability and efficiency in high-throughput scenarios, making it a preferred choice for applications requiring concurrent processing ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

### Latency: Response Time per Request

Latency measures the time taken by the framework to generate a response for a single request. This metric is particularly important for real-time applications, such as chatbots or interactive systems, where user experience depends on prompt responses.

#### Key Observations:
- **Short Prompts**: For short prompts, **vLLM** demonstrated lower latency due to its **CUDA graph optimizations**, which minimize computational overhead during prefill operations. For example, in tests using the **Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO** model on 8x Nvidia A10G GPUs, vLLM achieved a latency of **0.45 seconds**, compared to SGLang's **0.57 seconds** ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).
- **Long Prompts**: SGLang's performance improved significantly for long prompts and large batch sizes, where its **RadixAttention** mechanism optimized token generation. In such scenarios, SGLang's latency remained stable, while vLLM's latency increased ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).

#### Comparison Table:

| **Framework** | **Scenario**              | **Model**          | **Hardware**         | **Latency (Short)** | **Latency (Long)** |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| SGLang         | Short Prompts             | Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO | 8x Nvidia A10G GPUs | 0.57 seconds       | Stable            |
| vLLM           | Short Prompts             | Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO | 8x Nvidia A10G GPUs | 0.45 seconds       | Increased         |

These findings suggest that while vLLM is better suited for latency-sensitive applications involving short prompts, SGLang excels in scenarios requiring high throughput and long prompt processing ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).

### Memory Efficiency: Resource Utilization

Memory efficiency is a crucial metric for evaluating the resource utilization of inference frameworks, especially when deploying large models on limited hardware. Efficient memory usage allows frameworks to handle larger models or more concurrent requests without exceeding hardware constraints.

#### Key Observations:
- **PagedAttention in vLLM**: vLLM's **PagedAttention mechanism** optimizes memory usage by dynamically allocating memory based on the active tokens in the attention mechanism. This makes vLLM particularly suitable for scenarios with limited GPU memory ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).
- **RadixAttention in SGLang**: SGLang's **RadixAttention mechanism** is designed for high-throughput scenarios, but it requires more memory compared to vLLM. This trade-off enables SGLang to achieve higher throughput but may limit its applicability in resource-constrained environments ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).

#### Comparison Table:

| **Framework** | **Memory Optimization**   | **Strengths**                          | **Limitations**                       |
|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| vLLM           | PagedAttention            | Efficient memory usage for limited GPUs | Lower throughput in high-concurrency scenarios |
| SGLang         | RadixAttention            | High throughput for large batches       | Higher memory requirements            |

These observations highlight the trade-offs between memory efficiency and throughput, emphasizing the importance of selecting a framework based on specific deployment requirements ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

This section builds on the existing content by focusing on **performance metrics** such as throughput, latency, and memory efficiency, which were not covered in detail in previous subtopic reports. It complements the earlier discussions by providing structured comparisons and actionable insights for benchmarking vLLM and SGLang.

## Benchmarking Setup and Methodology

### Framework Initialization and Configuration

To ensure a fair comparison between **vLLM** and **SGLang**, it is critical to initialize both frameworks with identical configurations and hardware setups. This section outlines the steps required to prepare the benchmarking environment, focusing on model loading, GPU allocation, and framework-specific optimizations.

#### Model Loading
Both frameworks support loading models from popular repositories such as Hugging Face. For consistency, the **Llama3-70B-FP8** and **Llama3.1-8B** models will be used for benchmarking, as these models have been previously tested in similar studies ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

- **vLLM Initialization**:
  ```python
  from vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server import start_server

  start_server(
      model="NousResearch/Llama3-70B-FP8",
      tensor_parallel_size=8,
      port=30000
  )
  ```

- **SGLang Initialization**:
  ```python
  from sglang.launch_server import start_server

  start_server(
      model_path="NousResearch/Llama3-70B-FP8",
      tp=8,
      port=30000
  )
  ```

Both frameworks are configured to use **tensor parallelism** with 8 GPUs, ensuring equal resource allocation. The port number is standardized to avoid discrepancies in API accessibility.

#### GPU Allocation
The benchmarking tests will be conducted on **2x Nvidia H100 GPUs** with **80GB VRAM** each, connected via NV Bridge. This setup ensures optimal performance for both frameworks, as they are designed to leverage multi-GPU configurations ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

#### Framework-Specific Optimizations

---

### Test Scenarios and Metrics

The benchmarking tests are divided into two primary scenarios: **Sequential Requests** and **Concurrent Requests**. Each scenario evaluates different performance metrics, including throughput, latency, and memory efficiency.

#### Sequential Requests
Sequential requests measure the latency and tokens per second (TPS) for individual requests. This scenario is particularly relevant for applications requiring real-time responses, such as chatbots.

- **Test Setup**:
  - Generate 100 prompts of varying lengths (e.g., 50, 250, and 500 tokens).
  - Limit output tokens to 500 and set the temperature to 0.01 for consistency ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).
  - Example Python code for sequential requests:
    ```python
    import time

    def send_request_sequentially(client, num_requests):
        for i in range(num_requests):
            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model="Llama3-70B-FP8",
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a long essay on the topic of Thailand."}],
                max_tokens=500,
                temperature=0.01
            )
            print(response)
            time.sleep(2)  # Delay between requests
    ```

#### Concurrent Requests
Concurrent requests evaluate throughput and scalability under high-concurrency scenarios. This test is designed to simulate enterprise-level batch processing.

- **Test Setup**:
  - Generate 100 prompts with shared prefixes to test SGLang's optimization for structured inputs ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).
  - Use threading to send multiple requests simultaneously.
  - Example Python code for concurrent requests:
    ```python
    import threading

    def send_request_concurrently(client, num_requests):
        def send_request(i):
            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model="Llama3-70B-FP8",
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Request {i}: Write a summary of AI advancements."}],
                max_tokens=500,
                temperature=0.01
            )
            print(response)

        for i in range(num_requests):
            threading.Timer(0.06125 * i, send_request, args=(i + 1,)).start()
    ```

#### Metrics for Evaluation
- **Throughput (TPS)**: Tokens generated per second, calculated as:
  ```python
  throughput = total_tokens / total_time
  ```
- **Latency**: Average time taken per request, measured in seconds.
- **Memory Efficiency**: GPU memory usage during inference, monitored using tools like **nvidia-smi**.

### Data Collection and Analysis

To ensure reproducibility and accuracy, the benchmarking tests will be conducted multiple times under identical conditions. The collected data will include:
1. **Tokens per Second (TPS)** for sequential and concurrent requests.
2. **Latency** for short and long prompts.
3. **Memory usage** during inference.

#### Data Logging
Both frameworks will log performance metrics to a CSV file for post-test analysis. Example Python code for logging:
```python
import csv

def log_results(filename, results):
    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(["Request Type", "Framework", "TPS", "Latency", "Memory Usage"])
        writer.writerows(results)
```

#### Statistical Analysis
The logged data will be analyzed using statistical methods to identify significant differences between the frameworks. Metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and confidence intervals will be calculated to ensure robust comparisons.

### Optimization Strategies for Deployment

This subsection provides recommendations for optimizing the deployment of **vLLM** and **SGLang** based on the findings from benchmarking tests. While previous sections have discussed performance metrics, this section focuses on actionable strategies to enhance framework efficiency.

#### vLLM Optimization
To maximize the efficiency of **vLLM**, consider the following strategies:
1. **Enable CUDA Graphs**: Activate CUDA graph optimizations to reduce latency for short prompts ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).
2. **PagedAttention Configuration**: Fine-tune the **PagedAttention mechanism** to dynamically allocate memory based on active tokens, ensuring efficient resource utilization ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).
3. **Batch Size Adjustment**: Limit batch sizes to avoid performance degradation under high-concurrency scenarios. For example, keep batch sizes below **64 requests** to maintain stable throughput ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

#### SGLang Optimization
To enhance the performance of **SGLang**, implement the following strategies:
1. **RadixAttention Tuning**: Optimize the **RadixAttention mechanism** for structured inputs with shared prefixes to maximize throughput ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).
2. **Concurrent Request Handling**: Use threading or asynchronous programming techniques to efficiently manage concurrent requests. For example, stagger request timings to avoid overwhelming the system ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).
3. **Hardware Scaling**: Deploy SGLang on multi-GPU setups with high memory capacity, such as **2x Nvidia H100 GPUs**, to handle large batches effectively ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).

### Future Considerations for Framework Selection

This subsection explores emerging trends and considerations that may influence the selection of inference frameworks in the future. Unlike previous sections, which focused on current benchmarking results, this section provides insights into potential advancements and their implications.

#### Emerging Technologies
1. **Fused Kernels**: Recent developments in fused kernels for **vLLM** have improved its performance in mixture-of-experts (MoE) inference tasks. Incorporating similar optimizations into **SGLang** could further enhance its scalability ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).
2. **FP8 Precision**: Both frameworks are increasingly adopting **FP8 precision** for model inference, enabling faster computations and reduced memory usage. Future benchmarks should evaluate the impact of FP8 precision on throughput and latency ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

#### Application-Specific Customizations
1. **Structured Inputs**: Frameworks like **SGLang** are optimized for structured inputs with shared prefixes. Future applications should explore how to leverage this feature for tasks such as automated report generation or template-based content creation ([GitHub Issue #169, 2024](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/169)).
2. **Real-Time Systems**: As real-time systems evolve, **vLLM's** latency optimizations may become increasingly relevant for applications requiring instant responses, such as voice assistants or live translations ([Chitpakdee, 2024](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

These considerations highlight the importance of staying updated on advancements in inference frameworks to ensure optimal deployment strategies for future applications.
