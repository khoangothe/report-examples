## Introduction

The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has led to the development of specialized inference frameworks designed to optimize their performance. Among these frameworks, **vLLM** and **SGLang** have emerged as prominent solutions, each catering to distinct aspects of LLM serving and execution. This report aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of their performance using Python-based benchmarking techniques.

### Overview of vLLM and SGLang

**vLLM** is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference library for LLMs, developed with a focus on optimizing serving throughput and memory management. It leverages innovative techniques such as **PagedAttention** to efficiently manage attention key-value memory and supports features like continuous batching, speculative decoding, and quantization ([vLLM GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)). These capabilities make vLLM particularly suitable for scenarios requiring high-speed inference and scalability.

On the other hand, **SGLang** is a structured generation library designed to facilitate efficient execution of complex generation tasks. It introduces features such as **RadixAttention**, zero-overhead batch scheduling, and cache-aware load balancing to enhance inference performance. SGLang also provides a flexible programming interface for structured generation workflows, making it ideal for applications requiring advanced control over generation processes ([SGLang GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)).

### Motivation for Comparison

While both frameworks are tailored for LLM inference, their design philosophies and optimization strategies differ significantly. vLLM prioritizes serving throughput and memory efficiency, whereas SGLang emphasizes structured generation and batch execution. Understanding their relative performance across key metrics—such as throughput, latency, and memory usage—is crucial for selecting the appropriate framework for specific use cases.

### Benchmarking Approach

To compare the performance of vLLM and SGLang, this report will utilize Python-based benchmarking scripts inspired by their respective repositories. The benchmarking process involves:

1. **Model Loading**: Using the same LLM (e.g., LLaMA or GPT-based models) in both frameworks to ensure consistency.
2. **Prompt Dataset**: Employing a common dataset, such as ShareGPT, to provide uniform input prompts.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Measuring throughput (tokens per second), latency (time per request), and memory usage during inference.
4. **Execution Environment**: Running benchmarks on identical hardware configurations to eliminate external variability.

### Existing Benchmarks and Observations

Preliminary benchmarks indicate that SGLang achieves higher throughput in structured generation scenarios, with reports suggesting up to 1532 tokens per second compared to vLLM's 661 tokens per second ([Saidinesh, 2025](https://medium.com/@saidines12/sglang-vs-vllm-part-1-benchmark-performance-3231a41033ca)). However, vLLM demonstrates superior memory efficiency and scalability in concurrent request scenarios ([GPU Mart, 2025](https://www.gpu-mart.com/blog/how-to-benchmark-vllm-online-serving)). These findings underscore the need for a detailed, reproducible comparison to validate and expand upon these results.

## Analysis and Discussion

### Framework Optimization Strategies

While previous sections have highlighted the core features and performance metrics of **vLLM** and **SGLang**, this section delves into the optimization strategies employed by each framework and their implications for real-world applications. Unlike the earlier focus on installation and benchmarking methodology, this analysis emphasizes the architectural and algorithmic differences that drive their performance.

#### Memory Management Techniques

**vLLM** employs a unique **PagedAttention** mechanism to optimize memory usage during inference. This technique dynamically allocates attention key-value memory, ensuring efficient utilization of GPU resources even for large-scale models. By contrast, **SGLang** leverages **RadixAttention**, which focuses on prefix caching to accelerate repeated context reuse. While both methods aim to reduce memory overhead, their approaches differ significantly:

| **Framework** | **Memory Optimization Technique** | **Impact on Performance** |

| SGLang        | RadixAttention                   | Faster inference for structured generation tasks with repeated context ([SGLang GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)). |

These differences highlight vLLM's suitability for high-load environments and SGLang's focus on structured workflows.

#### Batch Execution and Scheduling

Both frameworks implement batch execution strategies to maximize throughput, but their scheduling mechanisms differ:

- **vLLM**: Continuous batching dynamically groups incoming requests, ensuring optimal GPU utilization. This approach is particularly effective for real-time serving scenarios with unpredictable request patterns ([vLLM Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai)).
- **SGLang**: Zero-overhead batch scheduling minimizes latency by pre-scheduling requests and balancing GPU load. This strategy excels in structured generation tasks, where batch execution is predictable ([SGLang Documentation](https://docs.sglang.ai)).

| **Framework** | **Batch Execution Strategy** | **Strengths** |
|---------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| vLLM          | Continuous batching          | Ideal for real-time serving with variable request patterns. |
