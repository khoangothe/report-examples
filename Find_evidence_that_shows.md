# The Usability of Buttons: Icons and Labels vs. Alternatives

## Introduction

In the realm of user interface design, buttons serve as critical elements that facilitate user interaction with systems. Their usability directly impacts the efficiency, accessibility, and overall experience of a product. A recurring debate among designers and researchers is whether buttons that combine icons and labels are more effective than those that use only icons or labels. This report explores evidence from decades of usability studies, drawing on insights from academic research, industry experts, and real-world testing.

Icons offer visual cues that can make interfaces aesthetically appealing and intuitive, but their effectiveness hinges on users' familiarity with their meaning. Text labels, on the other hand, provide clarity and reduce ambiguity, especially in cases where icons fail to convey their intended purpose. Research consistently demonstrates that combining icons with text labels yields superior usability outcomes, addressing the shortcomings of icon-only or text-only designs ([Nielsen Norman Group, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).

Empirical studies have shown that users struggle to interpret unlabeled icons, even when performing routine tasks. For instance, Trevor Calabro’s research highlights that users often rely on the physical location of icons rather than recognizing their meaning, leading to confusion when layouts change ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)). Similarly, Don Norman’s findings confirm that icons alone perform the worst in usability tests, while text alone performs better, and text combined with icons performs best ([UX StackExchange, 2010](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)).

The advantages of combining icons and labels extend beyond clarity. This approach reduces cognitive load, accelerates task completion, and ensures accessibility for users with disabilities. It also aligns with industry standards for inclusive design, addressing usability challenges posed by tooltips, mobile interfaces, and cultural differences ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label); [Nielsen Norman Group, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).

This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the evidence supporting the usability of buttons with icons and labels. By examining key studies, industry practices, and user feedback, the report delivers a high-level, definitive answer to this critical question in interface design.
## Introduction to Button Usability

### The Role of Buttons in User Interfaces

Buttons are fundamental elements in user interface (UI) design, serving as interactive components that enable users to perform specific actions such as submitting forms, navigating pages, or triggering functionalities. Their usability directly impacts user satisfaction, task efficiency, and overall accessibility of digital products. The design of buttons, including the use of icons, text labels, or a combination of both, plays a critical role in ensuring clarity and ease of use ([Nielsen Norman Group, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).

Studies in human-computer interaction have shown that poorly designed buttons can increase cognitive load, cause confusion, and lead to errors during task completion. For instance, unlabeled icons or ambiguous text can make users hesitant or reliant on secondary aids such as tooltips. Conversely, well-designed buttons with clear visual and textual cues reduce ambiguity, enhance recognition, and improve task performance ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

### Factors Influencing Button Usability 

#### Cognitive Load Reduction
One of the primary factors influencing button usability is cognitive load. Cognitive load refers to the mental effort required to interpret and interact with UI elements. Buttons with both icons and text labels significantly reduce cognitive load by leveraging visual recognition and textual clarification simultaneously. This combination ensures that users can quickly identify the button’s function without guessing or searching for additional information ([StackExchange, 2010](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)).

#### Accessibility and Inclusivity
Accessibility is another crucial factor in button usability. Buttons that include text labels alongside icons cater to a broader audience, including users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers. For example, unlabeled icons can create barriers for users who cannot visually interpret the meaning of the icon, whereas text labels provide explicit clarity ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)). Additionally, labeled buttons comply with accessibility standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), ensuring inclusivity in design.

#### Recognition vs. Recall
Button usability is also influenced by the balance between recognition and recall. Recognition-based designs, such as buttons with icons and labels, allow users to immediately understand the functionality without needing prior knowledge or memory recall. In contrast, designs relying solely on icons or text may require users to recall the meaning from previous experiences, which can lead to errors and inefficiencies ([Nielsen Norman Group, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).

### Importance of Context in Button Design

The effectiveness of button design is highly dependent on its context of use. For instance, in applications where users perform repetitive tasks daily, icon-only buttons may eventually become familiar through learned behavior. However, in applications with infrequent use or complex functionalities, buttons with icons and text labels are essential to prevent confusion and ensure usability from the first interaction ([UX Planet, 2015](https://uxplanet.org/unlabeled-icons-sacrificing-usability-to-look-pretty-415408a0e115)).

Moreover, cultural and regional differences can influence the interpretation of certain icons. For example, a shopping cart icon may be universally understood in e-commerce, but its representation can vary between regions—such as a basket in the UK versus a cart in the US. Text labels mitigate such discrepancies by providing explicit clarification alongside the visual cue ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

By considering these factors—cognitive load, accessibility, recognition vs. recall, and context—designers can create buttons that maximize usability, streamline user interactions, and accommodate diverse user needs.
## Overview of Buttons with Icons and Labels

### Enhanced Usability Through Combined Elements

Buttons that incorporate both icons and text labels are widely regarded as a superior design choice in user interfaces due to their ability to combine visual and textual cues. This pairing addresses two critical aspects of usability: recognition and clarity. Icons serve as quick visual identifiers, while text labels eliminate ambiguity by explicitly stating the button's function. Research from the [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/) highlights that combining icons with labels significantly reduces cognitive load and improves task completion rates, particularly for new or infrequent users.

A 2014 usability study conducted by Nielsen Norman Group found that users consistently preferred buttons with both icons and labels over icon-only or text-only buttons. This preference was attributed to the reduced need for users to guess the meaning of icons, which can vary widely across different contexts ([Aurora Harley, NN/g](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)). Additionally, labeled icons were shown to improve accessibility, ensuring that users relying on screen readers or other assistive technologies could navigate interfaces more effectively ([Trevor Calabro, Substack](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

### Recognition vs. Recall in User Interaction

The principle of "recognition over recall" plays a pivotal role in the effectiveness of buttons with icons and labels. Recognition refers to the ability to identify an element based on its visual or textual cues, whereas recall requires users to remember the function of an element without direct prompts. Buttons that combine icons and labels leverage recognition, making interfaces more intuitive and reducing the learning curve for first-time users.

For example, a study cited by [UX StackExchange](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links) demonstrated that users performed tasks more efficiently when buttons included both icons and labels. The study noted that while experienced users may rely on memorized button positions over time, novice users benefit from the immediate clarity provided by labeled icons. This dual benefit underscores the importance of combining visual and textual elements to cater to a broader range of user experiences.

### Accessibility and Inclusivity

Accessibility is another critical factor in favor of buttons with icons and labels. Unlabeled icons can pose significant challenges for users with disabilities, particularly those who rely on screen readers. Text labels ensure that button functions are clearly conveyed, making interfaces more inclusive. According to the [Baymard Institute](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label), unlabeled icons often fail accessibility audits, which can have legal and reputational repercussions for organizations.

In addition to aiding users with disabilities, labels help overcome cultural and linguistic barriers. While some icons may be universally recognized (e.g., a magnifying glass for "search"), many are subject to regional or contextual interpretations. For instance, the "cart" icon used in e-commerce platforms is more commonly represented as a "basket" in the UK, illustrating the potential for confusion in global applications ([Aurora Harley, NN/g](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)). By combining icons with labels, designers can ensure that interfaces are universally understandable, thereby improving usability across diverse user demographics.
## Comparison of Buttons: Icons-only, Text-only, and Icons+Labels

### Performance of Icons-only Buttons

Icons-only buttons are often visually appealing but come with significant usability challenges. Research has consistently shown that icons alone are difficult for users to interpret correctly without prior training or extensive familiarity. A study by [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/) highlights that icons alone are ambiguous due to the lack of universal standards. For example, while the "floppy disk" icon is widely recognized for saving files, other icons such as the "hamburger menu" or the "heart" icon can have varied meanings across different applications, leading to confusion ([NN/g, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).

Additionally, Wiedenbeck (1999) found that users struggled to correctly interpret and retain the meaning of icons in end-user applications, especially for abstract concepts like "Invoice" or "Bid" ([UX StackExchange](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)). Even experienced users often rely on location rather than the actual icon for navigation, as revealed in Trevor Calabro’s usability studies ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

### Performance of Text-only Buttons

Text-only buttons are simpler but often perform better than icons-only buttons in usability tests. Text provides immediate clarity, reducing the cognitive load required for interpretation. This is particularly effective for abstract actions or commands, as text labels explicitly describe the function of the button. According to [UX StackExchange](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links), text-only buttons outperform icons-only ones in terms of recognition and task completion efficiency.

However, text-only buttons have their limitations, especially in space-constrained interfaces. For example, lengthy text labels may clutter the design and reduce scanability, particularly on mobile devices where screen space is limited ([NN/g, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)). Despite these drawbacks, text-only buttons remain preferable to icons-only buttons in scenarios where clarity is paramount.

### Performance of Icons+Labels Buttons

Buttons combining icons and labels consistently outperform both icons-only and text-only buttons in usability tests. This combination leverages the strengths of both elements, providing visual interest and instant recognition while ensuring clarity through textual descriptions. According to [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/), pairing icons with labels mitigates ambiguity and reduces errors, allowing users to navigate interfaces more effectively.

Calabro (2025) conducted multiple studies to compare icons-only, text-only, and icons+labels buttons. The findings revealed that users were significantly more successful in completing tasks when both icons and labels were present. For example, in a matching test, users struggled to associate icons with their meanings in an icons-only interface but performed much better when labels were added ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

Furthermore, combining icons with labels enhances accessibility. Unlabeled icons often fail to meet accessibility standards, making them unsuitable for users reliant on screen readers or those with cognitive impairments. Labels provide a clear textual reference, ensuring inclusivity for all user groups ([NN/g, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).

## Key Findings from Usability Studies

### Study Results on Icon Usability

A comprehensive study conducted by the [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/) highlights the usability challenges associated with icons used alone. The study emphasizes that text labels are essential to reduce ambiguity and improve clarity. Key findings include:

- **Ambiguity Without Labels**: Icons alone often confuse users due to their lack of universal recognition. Even widely used icons like the "hamburger menu" can have varied meanings across different applications, leading to misinterpretation ([Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).
- **Enhanced Recognition with Text Labels**: Adding text labels alongside icons significantly improves recognition and usability, allowing users to understand functionality without relying on prior experience ([Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).
- **Critical Role in Navigation**: Labels are particularly important for navigation icons, as they provide immediate clarity and reduce the cognitive load required to interpret visual elements ([Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).

These findings demonstrate that combining icons with labels is superior to using icons alone, especially for complex or non-standard tasks.

### Comparative Usability Studies

Empirical research comparing buttons with icons-only, text-only, and icons+labels has consistently shown that the combination of icons and labels outperforms other designs. For example, studies cited in the [UX StackExchange](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links) discussion reveal:

- **Icons Alone Perform Worst**: Icons-only buttons are the least effective, often requiring users to guess their meaning or memorize icon locations ([UX StackExchange](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)).
- **Text Alone is Better**: Text-only buttons perform better than icons alone, as they provide clear and direct information ([UX StackExchange](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)).
- **Icons+Labels Perform Best**: Buttons that combine icons with labels consistently deliver the highest usability, enabling faster task completion and fewer errors ([UX StackExchange](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)).

This comparative analysis highlights the importance of pairing icons with text labels to maximize usability across diverse user groups.

### Real-World Testing Insights

Trevor Calabro's recent article on [Substack](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label) provides real-world evidence from usability testing across multiple projects. His findings reinforce the need for labeled icons:

- **Failure to Match Icons to Descriptions**: In a study where users were asked to match unlabeled icons to their descriptions, even experienced users struggled. The test revealed that icons alone were insufficient for task clarity ([Trevor Calabro](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).
- **Reliance on Location Over Recognition**: Another study demonstrated that users relied on memorizing icon locations rather than recognizing their meanings. When icon positions were shuffled, users were unable to complete tasks efficiently ([Trevor Calabro](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).
- **Accessibility Benefits**: Labeled icons were shown to improve accessibility, especially for users relying on assistive technologies like screen readers. Unlabeled icons, by contrast, hindered navigation and task completion ([Trevor Calabro](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

These findings underline the practical advantages of combining icons with labels, both for usability and accessibility compliance.

This table summarizes the findings from key usability studies, illustrating the effectiveness of combining icons with labels.
## Benefits of Combining Icons with Labels

### Enhanced User Recognition and Task Efficiency

Combining icons with labels significantly improves user recognition and task efficiency by reducing ambiguity and cognitive load. Research from Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) highlights that icons alone often fail to convey meaning due to the absence of universal standards ([NN/g, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)). Text labels alongside icons clarify their meaning, enabling users to understand functionality more quickly and accurately. For instance, usability tests conducted by Trevor Calabro demonstrated that users struggled to match icons to their descriptions in tasks involving unlabeled icons but performed significantly better when labels were added ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

Additionally, Don Norman’s research supports this finding, emphasizing that text combined with icons works best compared to icons or text alone ([UX StackExchange, 2010](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)). This combination improves scanability by allowing users to visually and cognitively process information more efficiently.

### Accessibility Improvements for Diverse User Groups

Icons paired with labels enhance accessibility for users with diverse needs, including those with disabilities. Unlabeled icons can create barriers for users relying on assistive technologies such as screen readers. Text labels ensure that all users, regardless of their ability to interpret visual elements, can navigate interfaces effectively. For example, the NN/g article notes that visible text labels are crucial for navigation icons, particularly on touch devices where hover interactions are unavailable ([NN/g, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).

Trevor Calabro's studies further emphasize this point, revealing that unlabeled icons disproportionately affect users relying on accessibility tools, slowing navigation and increasing error rates ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)). These findings underline the importance of inclusive design practices that prioritize usability for all user groups.

### Reduction in User Errors and Improved Learning Curves

Another key benefit of combining icons with labels is the reduction in user errors and improvement in learning curves. Studies have shown that users often misinterpret icons when they are presented without accompanying labels, leading to confusion and mistakes. For example, usability tests conducted at Minitab revealed that users relied on icon positions rather than their visual representation when icons lacked labels, resulting in increased errors when icons were rearranged ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

Furthermore, labeled icons expedite the learning process for new users, as they provide clear guidance on button functionality. In contrast, unlabeled icons require users to memorize their meanings, which can be challenging and time-consuming. This aligns with findings from the UX StackExchange discussion, which suggests that the combination of text and icons supports both recognition and recall, aiding users in familiarizing themselves with interface elements more effectively ([UX StackExchange, 2010](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)).
## Challenges of Using Icons without Labels

### Lack of Standardization and Ambiguity

One of the fundamental challenges of using icons without labels is the lack of standardization across applications and platforms. While a few icons, such as the magnifying glass for search or the home icon for the homepage, are widely recognized, most icons lack universal meaning. For example, the three-line "hamburger" menu icon, often used to represent navigation, is interpreted differently depending on the context. Some applications use it for navigation menus, while others use similar designs for lists or filters, leading to user confusion ([Nielsen Norman Group, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).

Icons often fail to convey meaning effectively without accompanying labels, especially for abstract concepts or complex actions. For example, users in a usability study struggled to identify the meaning of icons representing actions like "save" or "edit" when the icons were presented without labels. Even experienced users required additional time and effort to interpret the icons ([Trevor Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

### Increased Cognitive Load and Guesswork

Icons without labels force users to rely on prior knowledge or guesswork, which increases cognitive load. This reliance on memory or interpretative skills can lead to slower task completion and higher error rates. Studies have shown that users often misinterpret icons, especially when performing tasks they are less familiar with. For example, in a matching test conducted by Trevor Calabro, participants struggled to pair unlabeled icons with their corresponding functions, even when the icons were designed for frequent tasks ([Trevor Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

Moreover, the absence of labels can disproportionately affect novice users or those with limited technical experience. These users often experience higher levels of frustration and disengagement when interacting with icon-only interfaces, as they lack the prior exposure needed to make accurate associations ([UX StackExchange, 2010](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)).

### Accessibility Barriers

Unlabeled icons present significant accessibility challenges, particularly for users with disabilities. Screen readers, which are essential for visually impaired users, struggle to interpret the meaning of icons without descriptive text. This lack of accessibility compliance can lead to usability issues and potentially violate legal standards, such as those outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). For example, tooltips, often used as a substitute for labels, are inaccessible on touch devices and require additional interaction, further compounding the issue for users relying on assistive technologies ([Nielsen Norman Group, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).

Additionally, unlabeled icons can create barriers for users with cognitive disabilities or those who are not fluent in the platform's primary language. Labels provide critical context, ensuring that all users, regardless of ability or background, can interact with the interface effectively ([Trevor Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

### Poor Memorability and Reliance on Positioning

Even when users initially learn the meaning of unlabeled icons, their ability to recall these meanings in future interactions is limited. Research has demonstrated that users often rely on the location of icons rather than their visual characteristics. When the position of icons is altered, users frequently lose their ability to identify their functions. For example, in a study by Trevor Calabro, experienced users became disoriented when icons were shuffled, revealing that they had memorized the icons' positions rather than their visual meanings ([Trevor Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

This reliance on spatial memory undermines the usability of icon-only interfaces, particularly in dynamic or responsive designs where icon placement may shift across screen sizes. Without labels to provide consistent context, users are left to re-learn the interface with each layout change, resulting in a frustrating and inefficient user experience ([UX StackExchange, 2010](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)).
## Conclusion and Recommendations  

### Practical Recommendations for Icon and Label Usage  

While previous sections analyzed usability studies and benefits of combining icons with labels, this section focuses on actionable recommendations for designers and developers to optimize button usability. These recommendations are based on empirical findings from multiple sources.  

1. **Mandatory Use of Labels for Ambiguous Icons**  
   Icons that lack universal recognition, such as custom icons or abstract representations, must be accompanied by visible text labels to eliminate ambiguity. Research by Nielsen Norman Group highlights that even commonly used icons like the "hamburger menu" or "heart" symbol can be misinterpreted depending on their placement and context ([NN/g, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).  

2. **Positioning Text Labels for Maximum Visibility**  
   Labels should be positioned either beneath or beside the icon to ensure clarity and avoid confusion. Studies suggest that hover-revealed labels, while space-efficient, increase interaction costs and fail on touch devices ([StackExchange, 2010](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)).  

3. **Avoid Reliance on Tooltips for Critical Information**  
   Tooltips should serve as supplementary information rather than primary labels. Trevor Calabro’s research emphasizes that tooltips are slow and inaccessible for touchscreen users, thereby reducing usability ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).

### Addressing Common Design Trade-Offs  

To ensure optimal usability while balancing aesthetic considerations, designers must address certain trade-offs:  

1. **Balancing Minimalism and Functionality**  
   While minimalist designs may appear cleaner, they often sacrifice usability. Designers must prioritize clarity over aesthetics by including labels for icons, especially in navigation and action buttons ([UX Planet, 2015](https://uxplanet.org/unlabeled-icons-sacrificing-usability-to-look-pretty-415408a0e115)).  

2. **Testing for Recognizability and Memorability**  
   Conduct iterative usability tests to verify whether users can recognize and remember icons. For example, Trevor Calabro’s studies revealed that users rely on location rather than icon meaning when navigating interfaces, underscoring the importance of labels ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).  

3. **Standardization of Icon Design**  
   Whenever possible, use standardized icons for universal actions, such as "search" (magnifying glass) or "home" (house icon). However, even these should be accompanied by labels to support first-time users and diverse audiences ([NN/g, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).  

---

### Recommendations for Accessibility  

Accessibility is a critical aspect of button design, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can interact with interfaces effectively.  

1. **Compliance with Accessibility Standards**  
   Unlabeled icons fail to meet accessibility requirements, particularly for screen readers and users with cognitive impairments. Labels ensure compliance with standards like WCAG and ISO ([Calabro, 2025](https://trevorcalabro.substack.com/p/every-icon-needs-a-label)).  

2. **Inclusive Design for Diverse Users**  
   Icons alone may exclude users unfamiliar with specific visual conventions. Adding labels ensures inclusivity across different cultural and educational backgrounds ([NN/g, 2014](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/)).  

3. **Mobile Optimization**  
   For mobile and tablet interfaces, text labels should be permanently visible, as hover-based interactions are not feasible on touch devices ([StackExchange, 2010](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links)).  

By implementing these recommendations, designers can create interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and inclusive.
