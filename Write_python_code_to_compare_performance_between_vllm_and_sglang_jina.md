## Performance Metrics for Comparison

### Time to First Token (TTFT)

Time to First Token (TTFT) is a critical metric for evaluating the responsiveness of large language model (LLM) inference frameworks. It measures the time taken by a model to process input tokens and generate the first output token during streaming. This metric is particularly important for applications requiring low latency, such as real-time chatbots or interactive systems.

#### Key Observations
- **vLLM**: In single-request scenarios, vLLM has demonstrated faster TTFT compared to SGLang. For example, benchmarks show that vLLM achieves nearly 10 times faster TTFT under specific configurations ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).
- **SGLang**: While SGLang excels in throughput, its TTFT performance can vary depending on the model architecture and concurrency settings. For instance, SGLang performs exceptionally well for certain models like Qwen but struggles with others like Mistral under high concurrency ([Clarifai Blog](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/comparing-vllm-lmdeploy-and-sglang)).

#### Factors Affecting TTFT
- **Scheduler Policies**: vLLM uses a first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduler, which prioritizes individual requests, whereas SGLang employs a load-prioritized (LPM) scheduler optimized for throughput. Switching SGLang's scheduler to FCFS can improve TTFT ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).
- **Memory Allocation**: Parameters like `gpu-memory-utilization` in vLLM and `mem-fraction-static` in SGLang affect how memory is allocated, impacting TTFT ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).

### Tokens Per Second (TPS)

Tokens Per Second (TPS) measures the overall speed of token generation by the model, both in total and per request. This metric is essential for assessing the throughput of LLM inference frameworks, particularly in scenarios involving high concurrency or large batch sizes.

#### Key Observations
- **SGLang**: Consistently outperforms vLLM in TPS, especially under concurrent request scenarios. For example, SGLang achieved a throughput of 460 tokens per second with a batch size of 64, compared to lower values for vLLM ([Medium Article](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).
- **vLLM**: While vLLM may lag behind SGLang in TPS, its performance is still competitive, particularly in single-request scenarios where it leverages features like Cached PagedAttention ([Clarifai Blog](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/comparing-vllm-lmdeploy-and-sglang)).

#### Factors Affecting TPS
- **Batch Size**: Larger batch sizes generally improve TPS for both frameworks, but SGLang's optimizations for mixed-chunk processing give it an edge ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).
- **Concurrency**: SGLang's Python-based batch scheduler is highly efficient in handling concurrent requests, often matching or outperforming C++-based systems ([Clarifai Blog](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/comparing-vllm-lmdeploy-and-sglang)).

### Resource Utilization Efficiency

Resource utilization efficiency evaluates how effectively a framework uses hardware resources, such as GPUs and CPUs, during inference. This metric is crucial for determining the cost-effectiveness and scalability of LLM frameworks.

#### Key Observations
- **vLLM**: Optimized for memory efficiency, vLLM supports distributed inference across heterogeneous hardware, including NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel devices. Its integration with FlashAttention and FlashInfer further enhances resource utilization ([Clarifai Blog](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/comparing-vllm-lmdeploy-and-sglang)).
- **SGLang**: While SGLang primarily focuses on throughput, it has recently added support for AMD devices, expanding its hardware compatibility. Innovations like RadixAttention and compressed state machines improve memory utilization during constrained decoding ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).

#### Factors Affecting Resource Utilization
- **Quantization**: Both frameworks support quantization formats like INT4 and INT8, which reduce precision to optimize performance. However, SGLang's mixed-chunk processing offers additional advantages in memory utilization ([Clarifai Blog](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/comparing-vllm-lmdeploy-and-sglang)).
- **Kernel Implementations**: SGLang leverages high-performance CUDA kernels from FlashInfer, while vLLM integrates optimized kernels with FlashAttention, enabling efficient computation ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).

By analyzing these metrics—TTFT, TPS, and resource utilization efficiency—developers can better understand the trade-offs between vLLM and SGLang, enabling informed decisions for their specific use cases.

Both **vLLM** and **SGLang** provide Python APIs and OpenAI-compatible endpoints. To interact with these endpoints, the `openai` Python library will be used. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install openai aiohttp
```

Additionally, ensure that **vLLM** and **SGLang** are installed and their servers are running. For example:

- **vLLM**: Start the server with the following command:
  ```bash
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 vllm serve /path/to/model --tensor-parallel-size=1 --gpu-memory-utilization=0.9 --max-model-len=20000 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  ```

  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model-path /path/to/model --tp=1 --mem-fraction-static=0.9 --context-length=20000 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 30000
  ```

#### Defining Benchmarking Parameters

The benchmarking script will use the following parameters:
- **Model**: `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`
- **Prompt**: `"Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms."`
- **Max Tokens**: 200
- **Number of Requests**: 100

These parameters ensure consistency across both frameworks, allowing for a fair comparison.

---

### Implementing the Benchmarking Script

The benchmarking script will measure **TTFT** and **TPS** by sending requests to the API endpoints of both frameworks. The script uses asynchronous programming to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

#### Core Benchmarking Function

The following function benchmarks a given API endpoint by sending concurrent requests and measuring the response times:

```python
import time
import asyncio
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

async def benchmark(endpoint, model_name, prompt, num_requests, concurrency):
    client = AsyncOpenAI(base_url=endpoint)
    latencies = []
    tokens_per_sec = []

    async def send_request():
        start_time = time.time()
        response = await client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model_name,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            max_tokens=200,
            stream=True
        )
        first_token_time = None
        tokens = 0
        async for chunk in response:
            if not first_token_time:
                first_token_time = time.time() - start_time
            tokens += 1
        total_time = time.time() - start_time
        latencies.append({
            "ttft": first_token_time,
            "total_time": total_time,
            "tokens": tokens
        })
        tokens_per_sec.append(tokens / total_time)

    tasks = [send_request() for _ in range(num_requests)]
    for i in range(0, len(tasks), concurrency):
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks[i:i + concurrency])

    avg_ttft = sum(l['ttft'] for l in latencies) / num_requests
    avg_tps = sum(tokens_per_sec) / num_requests
    return avg_ttft, avg_tps
```

#### Running the Benchmark

The script benchmarks both **vLLM** and **SGLang** by calling the `benchmark` function for each framework's API endpoint:

```python
async def main():
    # Configuration
    VLLM_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:8000/v1"
    SGLANG_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:30000/v1"
    MODEL_NAME = "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
    PROMPT = "Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms."
    NUM_REQUESTS = 100
    CONCURRENCY = 10

    # Benchmark vLLM
    print("Benchmarking vLLM...")
    vllm_ttft, vllm_tps = await benchmark(
        VLLM_ENDPOINT, MODEL_NAME, PROMPT, NUM_REQUESTS, CONCURRENCY
    )
    print(f"vLLM - Avg TTFT: {vllm_ttft:.2f}s, Avg TPS: {vllm_tps:.2f}")

    # Benchmark SGLang
    print("Benchmarking SGLang...")
    sglang_ttft, sglang_tps = await benchmark(
        SGLANG_ENDPOINT, MODEL_NAME, PROMPT, NUM_REQUESTS, CONCURRENCY
    )
    print(f"SGLang - Avg TTFT: {sglang_ttft:.2f}s, Avg TPS: {sglang_tps:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

---

When selecting between **vLLM** and **SGLang**, understanding the frameworks' suitability for specific use cases is critical. While previous sections have analyzed their performance metrics, this section focuses on practical recommendations based on observed strengths and weaknesses.

#### Real-Time Applications
**vLLM** is better suited for real-time applications such as chatbots and interactive systems due to its consistently lower **Time to First Token (TTFT)**. Its **Cached PagedAttention** mechanism and efficient memory management enable faster response times, making it ideal for scenarios where latency is a priority ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).

#### High-Concurrency Scenarios
For applications requiring high throughput, such as batch processing or enterprise systems handling concurrent requests, **SGLang** is the recommended choice. Its **RadixAttention** mechanism and **Python-based batch scheduler** allow it to outperform **vLLM** in **Tokens Per Second (TPS)** under concurrent loads ([Medium Article](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

#### Resource-Constrained Environments
In environments with limited hardware resources, **vLLM** provides better resource utilization efficiency. Its distributed inference capabilities and support for heterogeneous hardware make it a cost-effective option for deployment on devices with constrained computational power ([Clarifai Blog](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/comparing-vllm-lmdeploy-and-sglang)).

### Optimization Strategies for Improved Performance

While both frameworks offer robust performance, their efficiency can be further enhanced through parameter tuning and configuration adjustments. This section outlines strategies to optimize each framework for specific metrics.

#### Enhancing vLLM Performance
1. **Increase Chunked Prefill Size**: Adjusting the `--chunked-prefill-size` parameter to a higher value (e.g., 4096) can improve throughput without significantly impacting latency ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).
2. **Enable Prefix Caching**: Using the `--enable-prefix-caching` flag reduces redundant computations, further lowering TTFT ([Clarifai Blog](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/comparing-vllm-lmdeploy-and-sglang)).
3. **Distributed Inference**: Deploying vLLM across multiple GPUs or CPUs can scale its performance for larger workloads ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).

#### Enhancing SGLang Performance
1. **Switch Scheduler Policy**: Changing the default scheduler from **Load-Prioritized (LPM)** to **First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)** improves TTFT for latency-sensitive applications ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).
2. **Optimize Mixed-Chunk Processing**: Fine-tuning the `--enable-mixed-chunk` parameter can balance memory utilization and throughput ([Clarifai Blog](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/comparing-vllm-lmdeploy-and-sglang)).
3. **Leverage Torch.compile**: Enabling `--enable-torch-compile` integrates high-performance CUDA kernels, enhancing TPS for concurrent requests ([Medium Article](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

### Recommendations for Benchmarking and Deployment

To ensure accurate benchmarking and optimal deployment, the following recommendations should be considered:

#### Benchmarking Best Practices
1. **Standardize Hardware**: Use identical hardware configurations for both frameworks to eliminate bias. For example, NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40 GB VRAM are ideal for testing ([Clarifai Blog](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/comparing-vllm-lmdeploy-and-sglang)).
2. **Test Diverse Scenarios**: Evaluate performance under single-request and concurrent-request scenarios to capture both latency and throughput metrics ([Medium Article](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).
3. **Use OpenAI-Compatible APIs**: Benchmark using OpenAI-compatible endpoints to ensure consistency and ease of integration ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).

#### Deployment Recommendations
1. **Select Framework Based on Use Case**: Choose **vLLM** for latency-sensitive applications and **SGLang** for high-throughput scenarios ([Clarifai Blog](https://www.clarifai.com/blog/comparing-vllm-lmdeploy-and-sglang)).
2. **Optimize Parameters**: Tailor configuration settings such as chunked prefill size and scheduler policies to match workload requirements ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/4245)).
3. **Monitor Resource Utilization**: Regularly track GPU memory usage and CPU load to identify bottlenecks and adjust deployment strategies accordingly ([Medium Article](https://medium.com/@occlubssk/llm-inference-engines-performance-testing-sglang-vs-vllm-cfd2a597852a)).

By following these recommendations, developers can maximize the efficiency of **vLLM** and **SGLang**, ensuring optimal performance for their specific use cases.
